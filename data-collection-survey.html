    <b>You must be using Google Chrome to do this study. Please do NOT do this study if you have recently cleared your browsing history, or if this is not the computer and web browser you use for your everyday browsing activity.</b>
    <br><br>
This is a research study in which we are gathering your browsing activity and browsing history over a period of 5 weeks, so that we can learn how much time you are spending on sites, how many tabs you keep open at once, and what you are doing at any given time. You just need to install our Chrome extension and keep it installed for 5 weeks (we will pay a bonus of $1 for each week you keep it installed and are actively using the browser).
    <br><br>
To begin, please install our extension. The extension is <a href="https://github.com/gkovacs/browserlog">open-source</a> and will not share data without your consent. Your data will only be used for research by the <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/">Stanford HCI Research Group</a>  and will not be shared with other parties. You can uninstall the extension at any time if you donâ€™t wish your browsing data to be collected anymore (but we will pay you a bonus of $1 per week for keeping it installed and using the browser).
